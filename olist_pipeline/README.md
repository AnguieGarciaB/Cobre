*Context & Business Problem:*

```python
Cobre, a fintech company, needs a data-driven approach to evaluate marketing and sales performance. The goal is to understand which channels lead to the highest-quality and fastest-converting leads, forecast future leads, and optimize marketing efforts based on ROI.

Task Overview:
Design a conceptual data model that unifies leads, marketing sources, enrichment metadata, and conversion outcomes.


Data Models:
Leads Qualified (MQL) Data:
mql_id: Unique ID for the marketing-qualified lead.
first_contact_date: Date of first contact.
landing_page_id: ID of the landing page where the lead signed up.
origin: Source of the lead (e.g., organic, paid).

Leads Closed (Converted Leads) Data:
mql_id: ID of the marketing-qualified lead.
seller_id: ID of the associated seller.
sdr_id: Sales Development Rep ID.
sr_id: Sales Rep ID.
won_date: Date of conversion to a paying customer.

```python
what could be the best arquitecture of data in dbts snowflake to meet the goal
```

*Architecture Validation*
```python
I have the following staging files in Snowflake:

stg_apollo_enrichment.sql
stg_hubspot_leads.sql
stg_salesforce_order_items.sql
stg_salesforce_order_payments.sql
stg_salesforce_orders.sql

Could you please review the content of these files and confirm if they align with the business objectives? Do they make sense in terms of the architecture, and are they consistent with the overall data flow and strategy?

Propose or showcase a simplified dbt or SQL pipeline that prepares this data for analytics use. Simulate how youâ€™d integrate sources like HubSpot (marketing), Apollo (enrichment), and Salesforce (CRM) into Snowflake'.
